# Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien, a High School Senior (soon to be updated), hoping to become an astrophysicist in the future. 

To those close to me, I'm known as the "Chaotic One". I like to believe that means I have lots of ideas to contribute. 

>[!NOTE]
> Some fun facts about me:
> - I'm making my own tabletop world! To be set in the late 2100s. 
> - I'm a total metalhead ðŸŽ¸ - Royal Republic especially.
> - I do my own astrophotography - for my gallery, you can check my [blog](https://thespacer-blog.com).

Looking forward to working with you!
